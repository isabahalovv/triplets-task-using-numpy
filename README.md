# Triplets task using numpy package
---
### Write a function triplets that takes a number n as argument and returns n tuples of triplets from the arrays which has been selected randomly. And sum of first two elements of the triplet equals the third element using numbers below n. Please note that (a, b, c) and (b, a, c) represent same triplet.

Starting with first lines of code, **num** and **all_triplets** are counter of tuples in list and storage for storing tuples in, respectively. As you imagine, **while** loop is for not exceeding required number of tuples. Let's go on other steps in the form of list one by one too.

* **np.random.randint** generates random arrays with the size of 3.
* **if** condition checks the condition which is given above. (__sum of first two elements of the triplet equals the third element using numbers below n__)
